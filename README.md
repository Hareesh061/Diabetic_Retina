# what is this project about..?
Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision loss and blindness in people who have diabetes. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye).

A chronic and irreversible eye condition called diabetic retinopathy affects both vision and quality of life. Here we created convolutional neural network-based deep learning (DL) architecture for automated Diabetic Retinopathy detection. Systemic deep learning.

The dataset contains images of 2 classes as follows:
1. class 0 for Normal
2. class 1 for Mild
3. class 2 for Moderate
4. class 3 for Proliferate
5. class 4 for severe
